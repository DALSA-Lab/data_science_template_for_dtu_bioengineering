    "   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n",
    "   - Search for \"Remote - SSH\" and install it.\n",
    "3. **Configure SSH Host:**\n",
    "   - Type `Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host`.\n",
    "   - Enter your SSH connection string, e.g., `ssh DTU_NAME@login1.hpc.dtu.dk`.\n",
    "   - Choose the SSH configuration file to update (usually `~/.ssh/config`).\n",
    "4. **Connect to the HPC Server:**\n",
    "   - Click on the green indicator in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.\n",
    "   - Select the SSH host you just added to connect.\n",
